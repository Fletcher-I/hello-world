# hello-world
Hey, my name is Ira Fletcher. 
I'm a thirty-one year old South African male. 
I've recently started to learn programming. 
I know basically nothing at this point. 

Thanks to GitHub for hosting. 
Looking forward to learning more.

I've started reading through Java, C and Python so far.
Busy making sure my development environment works, 
setting Path and stuff.

I've been interested in computers since I was eleven.
I have a long way to go.
